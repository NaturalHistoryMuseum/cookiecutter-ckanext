This is a template for NHM CKAN extensions.

To create a new extension using this template:

1. `git clone` this repo somewhere sensible (e.g. `~/.biscuits`)
2. `cd` to the directory you'd like to make the new extension in (e.g. `/path/to/ckan/src/`)
3. `cookiecutter ~/.biscuits/cookiecutter-ckanext`

You might also be able to use `cookiecutter gh:NaturalHistoryMuseum/cookiecutter-ckanext`, but I don't know if it works
with private repos.
